# Instructions for Creating Your First Website

## Preliminaries
0. **Make sure to have read my first email**
Here a [link](preparation/) for those of you that have might missed it out
1. **Create a folder for websites**  
   ```bash
   mkdir websites
   ```
2. **Move into the folder**  
   ```bash
   cd websites
   ```
3. **Create the website**  
   ```bash
   hugo new site name-of-the-site
   ```
4. **Move into the website folder**  
   ```bash
   cd name-of-the-site
   ```

## Choosing a Theme

1. Browse themes on [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
2. Click on a theme you like.
3. Read the theme's page for specific instructions. If instructions are provided (e.g., **Hugoplate**), follow them.
4. If no special instructions are provided:
   - Click on **Download** to go to the theme's GitHub page.
   - Read the README (if available) and check for an example site.
   - If you like the theme and it looks manageable, clone the repository:  
     ```bash
     cd themes
     git clone repo-url
     dir  # or ls, to confirm the repo is present
     ```

## Adding Content to Your Website

1. Follow the theme's instructions to set up the site. If no instructions are provided, here are some basic steps:
   - Create two folders and a landing page:  
     ```bash
     cd ../content
     mkdir about
     mkdir projects
     touch _index.md
     ```
   - Open `_index.md` and add the following (using markdown):  
     ```markdown
     # Welcome to My Website
     This is the homepage. Add a banner, a title, and some information here.
     ```
   - Create two pages:  
     - **About page:**  
       ```bash
       cd about
       touch index.md
       ```
       Open `index.md` and add:  
       ```markdown
       ## About Me
       Write a brief description about yourself here. You can also add links to your projects.
       ```
     - **Projects page:**  
       ```bash
       cd ../projects
       touch index.md
       ```
       Open `index.md` and add:  
       ```markdown
       ## My Projects
       Add information about your projects here. Include links if applicable.
       ```
2. Add links to the **Projects** and **About** pages on your landing page:
   - **Easy method:** Edit `content/_index.md` and add links manually.
   - **Advanced method:** Update your `hugo.toml` file:  
     ```toml
     [menu]
     [[menu.main]]
         name = "Home"
         url = "/"
         weight = 1

     [[menu.main]]
         name = "Projects"
         url = "/projects/"
         weight = 2

     [[menu.main]]
         name = "About"
         url = "/about/"
         weight = 3
     ```

## Checking the Website Locally

1. Update the `hugo.toml` file:
   - Change the `title` to your website's title.
   - Update the `theme` to the name of the folder where you cloned the theme.
2. Launch the website locally:  
   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```
3. Open your browser and verify the website.

## Connecting to GitHub

1. **Initialize a Git repository:**  
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Add the theme as a submodule:**  
   ```bash
   git submodule add url-of-the-theme-from-GitHub themes/name-you-used-locally
   ```
3. **Stage and commit all files:**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "My first commit with the initial files"
   ```

### Synchronizing with GitHub

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository:
   - Log in and navigate to your homepage.
   - Click the top-right button to create a new repo.
   - Name the repo (e.g., `mainwood` or `giacomo-vaccario`).
   - Leave other options as default, then click **Create**.
2. Copy the repo's URL.
3. Add the GitHub repo as the remote:  
   ```bash
   git remote add origin url-of-the-newly-created-repo
   ```
   Verify it worked:  
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
4. Push local changes to GitHub:  
   ```bash
   git push origin main  # or simply git push
   ```

### Verify Online

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page.
2. Confirm your website's files are visible online.

# Deploy Your Website Using GitHub Actions

This guide will show you how to automate the deployment of your Hugo website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

---

## What is GitHub Actions Workflow?

GitHub Actions allows you to automate tasks, such as building and deploying your Hugo website. The website will be hosted on a branch called `gh-pages` of your repository.  
**What is a branch?**  
A branch is a version of your repository. The `gh-pages` branch is commonly used to host files for websites or documentation.

---

## Steps to Set Up Deployment

### 1. Create the `gh-pages` Branch
Run the following command to create the `gh-pages` branch:  
```bash
git branch gh-pages
```

### 2. Create Folders for the Workflow
1. Inside your website directory, create a `.github` folder:  
   ```bash
   mkdir .github
   ```
2. Create a subfolder named `workflows`:  
   ```bash
   cd .github
   mkdir workflows
   ```

### 3. Create the Workflow File
1. Inside the `workflows` folder, create a file named `deploy_hugo.yml`:  
   ```bash
   touch deploy_hugo.yml
   ```
2. Open the file and copy-paste the following code:  

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy Hugo Site to GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       # Step 1: Check out the repository
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       # Step 2: Set up Hugo
       - name: Set up Hugo
         uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
         with:
           hugo-version: '0.112.0' # Specify the Hugo version

       # Step 3: Build the site
       - name: Build the Hugo site
         run: hugo --minify --destination docs

       # Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages
       - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
         uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
         with:
           publish_dir: ./public # This is the folder Hugo generates the site in
           github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Token to authenticate with GitHub
   ```

3. Save the file and review the steps in the workflow.

---

## 4. Commit and Push the Changes

1. Add the new files to your repository:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit the changes:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Deploy instructions for GitHub Actions"
   ```
3. Push the changes to GitHub:  
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

---

## 5. Trigger the Workflow

The workflow is triggered automatically on a `git push`. Follow these steps to monitor it:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Look for a workflow with the commit message "Deploy instructions ...".
4. Click on it twice to view the progress of the workflow.  
   The steps might take 10â€“50 seconds depending on your workflow's complexity.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If the deployment fails, here are common fixes:

### **1. Update Pages Settings**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** (top-right menu).
3. Under **Pages** (left menu):
   - **Build and deployment**: Ensure the source is set to `Deploy from branch`.
   - **Branch**: Select `gh-pages`.

### **2. Update Actions Settings**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** (top-right menu).
3. Under **Actions** (left menu):
   - Click **General**.
   - Scroll to the bottom and:
     - Allow "Read and write permissions."
     - Ensure actions are allowed to run.

### **3. Check Environment Settings**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** (top-right menu).
3. Under **Environment** (left menu):
   - Ensure there are no restrictions.

After following these steps, your Hugo website should be deployed on GitHub Pages! ðŸŽ‰
