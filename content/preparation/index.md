Dear EM group,

A couple of technical information for the first workshop.
The first workshop will be about learning GitHub and deploying a website.
To speed up the process, I would like to you to do the following:

- Bring your laptop and charger.
- Check that you know your admin passwords for installing software.
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads):
  - If you have no preferences, accept all default options.
  - At the question about the default editor, I suggest choosing Visual Studio Code or something you normally use for programming.
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
  - *(Optional)* [Connect your GitHub account to Copilot](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) (this should be possible for students and teachers).
- Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (the extended version):
  - For Windows, I have tested **winget**.
  - For MacOS, I have tested **Homebrew**.
  - For Linux, I have tested **snap**.
- Look at this [gallery for themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) for your website.
  - I have tested [one theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-xmin/) and created a [sample version of a personal page](https://giava90.github.io/tutorial-website-hugo/) (it took me about 20 minutes to set it up).
  - The [website](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/) of my previous group had a custom theme to replicate the ETH one.
  - This is a [second sample Shreyas](https://shreyas3105.github.io/Website/) has created (it required some CSS fixes).
  - I have now tested also [another theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugoplate/) that looks very cool and complete. This how it [renders](https://giava90.github.io/plate-example/).
- Read about markdown formatting.
- Create two short texts to populate the website:
  - One describing who you are (or what your project is about).
  - One about what you care about in your spare time or anything else you'd like to add to your website.
- Have three images in PNG or JPG format:
  - One horizontally long image to use as a banner for the website.
  - A profile picture.
  - A picture about your research or something you care about.

If you any trouble in performing any of these tasks, you can google for solutions, ask chatGPT or let me know.

Best regards,

Giacomo
